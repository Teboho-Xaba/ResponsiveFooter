# ResponsiveFooter

This is my first attempt design a footer from a picture I saw from Google by MDBootstrap.com (picture similar to the one attached from scalar.com) and the icons attached are from Material Design Icons

# HTML

The html consists of the footer tag with a main div for the main information such as the company name and brief information, and a bottom div that contains the information of the designer/copyright holder and icons for the different social media platforms where the company/designer can be found.
Three divs within the main div, namely company, products and links, have borders to their right.

# CSS

The color scheme used is different shades of grey, grid and grid-template-columns is used to divide the main div content into four columns with a gap of 2rems.
